TODO before first release

* Unit tests for gpg crypto.
* Put generalized backend wrapping somewhere other than gpgcrypto backend.
* Proper cmdline parsing
* Summary output after persist/materialize
* Optionally get already-uploaded list from the data bucket, in case the last
  backup broke before manifest was written.
