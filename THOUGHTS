== Block PUT scheduling ==
If there are many small blocks and many big blocks in the queue, they should
be scheduled so that big ones run in the background while the small ones
pop in and out. This is because big blocks are limited by bandwidth and small
ones by latency.

== GC ==
In order to GC you need access to all crypto keys, or you won't be able to
read the manifests to know what blocks are in use, and you won't know the
encrypted names of the blocks when you want to delete them.

== GPG ==
Use GPG for data encryption? KeyCzar?
Manifest could contain which crypto wrapper to use for a given block.
That way you don't have to re-upload if you change your mind.

== Amazon MD5 ==
Store MD5 as amazon metadata.
Also double-check when materializing.
