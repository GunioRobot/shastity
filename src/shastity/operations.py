"""
Operational interface to shastity.

Provides an easy-to-use high-level library interface to invoking all
of shastities main functions, de-coupled from the normal command line
interface.

This is the public interface intended for other software to use for
invoking shastity as a library rather than a shell tool, for tighter
integration.
